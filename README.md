## Shadow and the Dancer

Have you ever tried to create drawings like [this](https://www.marywagner.com/) in childhood? Two disks, one inside another; put a pen inside the little hole of the inner one, let it spin. The traces of spinning are so beautiful, and you can get thousands of variations only if you got many disks. I wonder what a browser would draw if it has a pen, so I inject the magic power of math through js, and let crazy parameters take over to see what I can get. Check all sketches [here](https://xdudu.github.io/shadow-and-the-dancer), you may find them a little different from what we used to draw, but share the feel.
